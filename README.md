Software for registration of trucks and there drivers

A transport company wants a software for registration of trucks and their drivers. For trucks it is necessary to store the license plate number, number of driven km, average fuel consumption according to technical specification and the number of liters of fuel purchased. For drivers store names and driver's license number.

1) Create a class for storing data on drivers and class of storing data on vehicles

Create a class which will be able to store data about multiple drivers and trucks and will be able to:

2) Add a new driver to the truck

3) Return exception when trying to add a truck or a driver that is already added

4) Add the number of liters of fuel purchased or km driven to the truck based on its license plate

5) Return an array of drivers, according to a given truck (one truck can have several drivers)

6) Convert all stored trucks and their drivers to a String

7) Write for this class an interface

8) Write a unit test for section 4)

9) Write a unit test for section 5)

10) Modify the class so that it automatically, after each change of liters of fuel purchased or driven km, calculate the deviation of the actual fuel consumption and average fuel consumption according technical specification. Than trucks will be always immediately sorted by this deviation.
